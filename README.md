|---|---|
| Use case | Regulated Product Teams use the service to quarantine risky artifacts across signed container releases, so secret exposure windows close automatically. |
| Pain point | Secret rotation depends on calendar reminders and late-night manual checks. |
| Success metric | Rotate leaked or stale credentials within 15 minutes without app downtime. |
| Cost | $0/mo on Render |

## Why this exists

Secret rotation depends on calendar reminders and late-night manual checks.. Regulated Product Teams use the service to quarantine risky artifacts across signed container releases, so secret exposure windows close automatically.

> This service shifts security left with scans, signatures, and admission controls so teams can ship safely. For this implementation, the service is designed to remove the operational friction behind Regulated Product Teams use the service to quarantine risky artifacts across signed container releases, so secret exposure windows close automatically..

## What this product does

This project ships a production-oriented service that exposes health, readiness, observability, and domain-specific endpoints for Regulated Product Teams use the service to quarantine risky artifacts across signed container releases, so secret exposure windows close automatically.. The implementation is intended to be deployed behind Kubernetes with secure defaults, CI validation, and rollback-ready manifests.

## Quick start

```bash
docker build -t secrets-navigator:local .
docker run -p 8080:8080 secrets-navigator:local
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

## Architecture
